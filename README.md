# Breast-Cancer-Predictor

## Objective:
The purpose of this repository is to apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning on a publicly available dataset for the prediction of breast cancer types. This project includes the application of various machine learning techniques such as exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling using algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM). The main goal is to predict whether breast cell tissue is malignant or benign.

The analysis is divided into the following parts, each of which is saved as a Jupyter Notebook in this repository:

1. **Identifying the Problem and Data Sources**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
3. **Pre-Processing the Data**
4. **Build Model to Predict Whether Breast Cell Tissue is Malignant or Benign**
5. **Optimizing the Support Vector Classifier**

## Dataset:

The Breast Cancer dataset is available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) and contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells. The dataset consists of the following:

- The first two columns: ID numbers of the samples and the corresponding diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign).
- Columns 3-32: 30 real-value features derived from digitized images of the cell nuclei.

## Part 1: Identifying the Problem and Getting Data
### Aim:
The first step in this analysis is to identify the types of information contained in our dataset. We'll use Python libraries to import the dataset and get familiar with its structure. By understanding the data, we will be able to determine how best to handle it, visualize it, and begin thinking about how to preprocess it for machine learning.

## Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Aim:
In this part of the project, we'll explore the variables and assess how they relate to the response variable (diagnosis). Using data exploration and visualization techniques, we will get a better understanding of the dataset.

### Tools Used:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and exploration.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing data distribution and relationships.
- Seaborn: For creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

### Process:
- Descriptive statistics to understand the basic structure of the dataset.
- Visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps to understand the relationships between features.

## Part 3: Pre-Processing the Data
### Aim:
The goal of data preprocessing is to find the most predictive features and filter out unnecessary data. We aim to enhance the predictive power of our model by reducing dimensionality and improving data quality.

### Key Steps:
- **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most relevant features for building the predictive model.
- **Feature Extraction and Transformation**: Applying techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

Data preprocessing is a critical step that improves model accuracy and performance.

## Part 4: Predictive Model Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
### Aim:
This part will focus on constructing predictive models to diagnose whether a tumor is benign or malignant. We'll use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification.

### Steps:
- **Model Construction**: Train an SVM model using the dataset to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.
- **Evaluation**: Use metrics such as confusion matrix and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate model performance.

SVM is an effective algorithm for binary classification tasks, and this model will help us predict tumor classification based on cell features.

## Part 5: Optimizing the Support Vector Classifier
### Aim:
The goal is to fine-tune the SVM model by adjusting its hyperparameters to achieve better accuracy and performance.

### Key Concepts:
- **Parameter Tuning**: Use techniques such as grid search or random search to tune the SVM classifierâ€™s parameters.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model with different parameter settings.

Optimizing the model will ensure that it provides the best possible predictions for the given dataset.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict breast cancer diagnosis. By following a structured process of data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and optimization, we aim to create an effective predictive model for cancer diagnosis.
